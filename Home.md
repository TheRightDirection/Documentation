## Welcome to the Documentation guidelines!

_Please for our collective sanity (at the very least mine) follow these rules. We want to ensure a logical and consistent design, and frankly I don't want to go on a twenty minute parenthesis hunt because someone hates tabbing._

***
This documentation set is broken down into sub-sections, starting with a general philosophy and specializing into each work environment. If you see it, it's there for a reason. I hate typing almost as much as you hate reading so here's the deal only read the sections you need to, but actually read **and follow** them.

`MR: In case you can't tell by now I have a tendency to go off on mini rants. For your sake I'll try to block off these sections. Feel free to read them or not, I really don't care. As long as you make pretty code I'm happy.`

Now then...
